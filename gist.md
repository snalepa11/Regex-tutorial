# Regular Expression: Matching an Email

A regular expression, also known as a regex, is a pattern that describes a set of strings. Regular expressions are commonly used in programming to search for, match, and manipulate text.

In the context of email validation, a regular expression can be used to check whether an email address is properly formatted. By defining a pattern that matches valid email addresses, we can use a regular expression to quickly and efficiently validate user input.

## Summary
